== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is HeyDay Web Push Native Notifications truly free and unlimited?  =
HeyDay Web Push Native Notifications are completely free and unlimited, read more [here](https://HeyDay.io/pricing.html).

= I am currently using a different plugin to enable Web Push Native Notifications on my site. How can I move my subscribers from my current plugin to HeyDay Web Push Native Notifications? =
After you have successfully integrated HeyDay Web Push Native Notifications to your site, go to the domain configuration area, look for the "Migrate DB" button. then follow the instructions at the tooltip next to it.
If you cannot attain your previous application server keys and your user subscriptions, then any previously subscribed users from the old web push service provider (such as OneSignal, etc.) will be automatically re-subscribed to HeyDay once they return to your site. Your previously subscribed users will NOT see opt-in prompt during re-subscription - it will happen silently & automatically.
But we strongly recommend using the migrate db, since notifications are all about bringing back users to your website.

yes. HeyDay Web Push Native Notifications offer a variety of custom prompt types.
 
= Will HeyDay Web Push Native Notifications show any type of HeyDay Branding such as "Powered by HeyDay" on my site if I use HeyDay Plugin?  =
